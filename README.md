Project Title: Lung Cancer Detection and Prognosis Using SVM, CNN, and K-Means Clustering

Project Description:

This project aims to develop an intelligent system for detecting lung cancer from CT scan images and predicting the survival rate or time-to-event outcomes of patients. The project employs various machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and K-Means Clustering to classify lung nodules and assess the survival rate of patients. By comparing the results from SVM, CNN, and K-Means algorithms, this system offers a comprehensive approach to lung cancer detection.

Key Features:

Lung Cancer Detection: Detects the presence of lung cancer by analyzing CT scan images using SVM, CNN, and K-Means algorithms.
Survival Rate Prediction: Estimates the survival rate of patients based on the detected cancerous nodules.
3D CNN for Prognosis: Utilizes 3D CNN to improve prognosis prediction based on a series of CT scan images.
Accurate Classification: SVM, CNN, and K-Means clustering are compared to determine the most accurate method for lung cancer classification.
Graphical Visualization: Includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, allowing users to upload datasets, view classification results, and compare survival rates using bar graphs.
Real-time Prediction: The system can predict whether a given CT scan image is normal or abnormal, assisting in quick decision-making for doctors.
Technologies Used:

Machine Learning Algorithms: SVM, CNN, K-Means Clustering
Libraries: Tkinter, OpenCV, Keras, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas
Platform: Python-based application
Dataset: CT scan images dataset (users can upload their own dataset for analysis)
Setup and Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
